The potential abilities developed in these vast halls are limitless."
 tech_avb_psi_corps_3:0 "Psi Institute"
 tech_avb_psi_corps_3_desc:0 "The highest echelon of godlike psionic beings, wielding powers that redefine local universal constants, find themselves limited by our existing learning facilities. Further advances in techno-psionic integration allows our largest and most sophisticated psionic ray emitters to channel psionic force from the local planetary population, instead of the students within the facility, isolating the institute within a protective ward. The collective psionic output of billions of ordinary citizens is only just potent enough to isolate the institute."
 tech_avb_clone_vats_2:0 "Clone Extrusion bays"
 tech_avb_clone_vats_2_desc:0 "Greater understanding of the cloning process and innovations in biological engineering finally overcome to last obstacle for cloning and genetic reproduction.
