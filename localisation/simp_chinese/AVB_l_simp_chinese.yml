 tech_avb_capital_4:0 "Decentralized Executive Authority"
 tech_avb_capital_4_desc:0 "As our dominion grows the demand for efficient administration exceeds the capacity of a single planetary establishment, no matter how immense. The creation of a decentralized executive branch allows the burden of administration to be distributed evenly across every major planet while also increasing the security of the overall executive authority. Development of new bureaucratic procedures to handle the decentralized administration brings a new era of urban development and civil infrastructure."
 tech_avb_capital_5:0 "Autonomous Administration Strategies"
 tech_avb_capital_5_desc:0 "The monolithic bureaucratic establishment that governs the trillions within our dominion requires an executive authority and tiered oversight committee that dwarfs some cities. The development of a micro-sentient autonomous governance framework allows similar or identical issues to be solved without the direct intervention of the executive branch and, within certain limits, the groundwork needed to establish new policies can now be enacted autonomously. With most of the previous executive workload automated the job of administration is now an abstract adjustment of parameters and data configurations."
 tech_avb_capital_6:0 "Universal Executive Intelligence"
 tech_avb_capital_6_desc:0 "With greater expansion of the immense executive branch the dependence on inflexible AIs is a hindrance to the governing body necessary to manage trillions of civil matters and legislative issues across the galaxy. The neural interfaces and subspace communication networks in every civilian district utilizes a small percentage of every citizen's neural strata. The complex task of maintaining order in a vast empire is now partially automated by the Executive Intelligence, or the collective intelligence created from the neural strata of every citizen. The executive branch now automatically expands with the population and employs the will of the people directly."
 
 tech_avb_hab_capital_4:0 "Autonomous Executive Nexus"
 tech_avb_hab_capital_4_desc:0 "The central executive authority providing administration for the entire monolithic habitat has reached maximum capacity and requires a more sophisticated solution to expand bureaucratic systems to accommodate an even larger population. A restricted level 5 micro-sentient AI with full executive control over every internal system provides a level of efficiency typically only found on long established planetside facilities, making the internal operations of every waste management, heat exchanger and data control system on the habitat work in unison with the precision of a biological organism."
 tech_avb_resort_capital_3:0 "Orbital Visitor Reception"
 tech_avb_resort_capital_3_desc:0 "The expansion of visitor reception facilities and resort administration into space is now feasible with a dedicated orbital reception hall attached to planetside transport stations and offices by a series of space elevators. With the increase in tourism and demand for additional resort complexes shuttle programs are overwhelmed, so the use of orbital elevators increases visitor throughput and overall comfort as guests descend to the surface in elevators that are practically five star resorts. The expansion of executive facilities in orbit allows for greater organization and a top down view on the vast leisure resorts covering the planetary surface."
 tech_avb_slave_capital_3:0 "Governor's Enclave"
 tech_avb_slave_capital_3_desc:0  "The expansion of palatial grounds, mansions, and territory to occupy a significant portion of the planet's land mass finally allows the nobility to breath, without the interference of the peasantry.

 tech_avb_psi_corps_3:0 "Psi Institute"
 tech_avb_psi_corps_3_desc:0 "The highest echelon of godlike psionic beings, wielding powers that redefine local universal constants, find themselves limited by our existing learning facilities. Further advances in techno-psionic integration allows our largest and most sophisticated psionic ray emitters to channel psionic force from the local planetary population, instead of the students within the facility, isolating the institute within a protective ward. The collective psionic output of billions of ordinary citizens is only just potent enough to isolate the institute."
 tech_avb_clone_vats_2:0 "Clone Extrusion bays"
 tech_avb_clone_vats_2_desc:0 "Greater understanding of the cloning process and innovations in biological engineering finally overcome to last obstacle for cloning and genetic reproduction.

Our new energy management facilities have the ability to devirtualize energy from a universal energy pool empire wide, colloquially known as the e-sphere."
 tech_avb_bio_reactor_3:0 "Matter-energy Conversion"
 tech_avb_bio_reactor_3_desc:0 "Further advances in matter-energy physics gives rise to a new methodology of biological mass to energy conversion with a perfect efficiency rate. New techniques that no longer rely on inefficient biological matter breakdown allow our systems to pass biological material through annihilation fields directly, without first having to mulch the matter into a fine paste. While biological matter is converted directly into its constituent energy it does nothing to dampen the natural instincts of the biological organism during processing, so newer facilities are equipped with additional soundproofing to reduce overall pollution."
