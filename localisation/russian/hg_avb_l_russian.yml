The virtual matrix is one of the most versatile simulations ever conceived, even by the standards of our best AI servitors. This complex also provides protection against our organic guests' ability to identify that they exist within a simulation, providing a second level of simulation in which they awaken as chosen ones fighting against evil machine overlords. Similarly, there is a third level of simulation, which they believe to be the end of the simulation, offering them an illusion of conclusion and space to explore additional narratives and choices in a surreal reality."
